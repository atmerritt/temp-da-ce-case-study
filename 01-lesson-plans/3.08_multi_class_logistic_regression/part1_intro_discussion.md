# Warm-up discussion questions

---

Recommended implementation:  
1. Give the students all the questions at once and have them discuss in small groups (~5 students per group) for a few minutes. For in-person classes, students can just chat with those nearest to them; for zoom breakout rooms can be created.
2. Bring everyone back and ask each group to share what they discussed/learned.

## Questions

1. Brainstorm some real-world examples of classification that you've encountered in your life. Can you think of any that specifically exist in the field/industry you're interested in?
2. Same question, but focus on examples where there are *more than two* categories. (This is called "multi-class classification!")
3. What new challenges do you think we might face as data analysts when working on multi-class classification rather than binary classification?
