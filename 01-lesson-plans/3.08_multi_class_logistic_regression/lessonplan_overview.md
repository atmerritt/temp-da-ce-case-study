# Lesson 3.8: Classification models ft. multi-class classification

This document provides an overview of the plan and offers a suggested timeline to follow.

## Learning goals
At the end of this lesson, students will:
1. understand what multi-class classification is and why it is relevant, 
2. be able to implement multi-class classification as an extension of binary classification using Logistic Regression,
3. understand what class imbalance is and how we can deal with it, and
4. gain experience working with a real-world dataset and making independent & strategic modeling decisions.

## Lesson overview
The goal here is to be as hands-on as possible. Each learning goal corresponds to its own section in the lesson, 
and will be a combination of (brief) instructor-led lectures, guided exercises, pair coding labs and discussions.
