# Lesson 3.8: Classification models ft. multi-class classification

This document provides an overview of the plan and offers a suggested timeline to follow.

## Lesson duration: 3 hours

## Learning goals
At the end of this lesson, students will:
1. understand what multi-class classification is and why it is relevant, 
2. be able to implement multi-class classification as an extension of binary classification using Logistic Regression,
3. understand what class imbalance is and how we can deal with it, and
4. gain experience working with a real-world dataset and making independent & strategic modeling decisions.

## Assessing student understanding
Instructors can check student understanding through the discussions (the questions are designed to reveal areas of comprehension vs confusion). Throughout the pair coding exercises you can also stop by various pairs of students and see what their progress is (this should work regardless of whether the lesson happens in-person or online, since in the latter case the students will be in breakout rooms or something equivalent).

## Logistics
* For pairs, to the extent that this is possible, try to pair students who have been struggling with students who are more comfortable with the material. This gives everyone an opportunity to learn from one another, and also helps to ensure that all the groups move at the same pace. (Note: "pairs" could also be groups of 3ish).
* If this is being run online, then the group work can take place via Zoom breakout rooms (or Gather spaces); encourage students to make use of whiteboard features.

## Lesson overview
The goal here is to be as hands-on as possible. Each learning goal corresponds to its own section in the lesson, 
and will be a combination of (brief) instructor-led lectures, guided exercises, pair coding labs and discussions.
